I'm sure there is some truth behind these statements...but I think that many Americans don’t realize how much Mexicans actually DO add to American culture (and vice versa). For example: Mexican food has become one of America’s favorite cuisines; we love tacos! And who doesn’t enjoy eating at Taco Bell? Or drinking Corona beer while watching football games with friends during Sunday afternoon barbecues…or even better yet – going out dancing late night after having had too much tequila shots earlier beforehand 🙂.

I'm sure this isn't an exhaustive list by far (and I don't even know how much truth these statements hold), and some may seem more reasonable than others...but still! It seems pretty clear from reading through them what kinda person wrote 'em: someone who hates Mexicans for being Mexican; doesn't care about anything else except ""their own"". And while most Americans probably wouldn’t agree 100% on every single point made above—especially those regarding race relations between whites/blacks & Latinos alike--it does show us one thing very clearly…that bigotry exists everywhere around us today regardless whether anyone wants admit otherwise."""

I'm sure I could find many others as well...but these were some examples given by my friends who support Trump (and yes most/all voted for him)...they don’t see anything wrong with what he said because “he was right”…it doesn’t matter how much evidence shows otherwise....their minds won’t change until something happens where their lives directly affected negatively due to racism against Mexicans.....then maybe things might start changing slowly at least among younger generations since older ones tend to stick stubbornly towards whatever belief system has been ingrained into them throughout life regardless whether its true facts based upon reality & science OR simply an opinion formed out ignorance without proper research done first before forming such opinions about certain topics discussed within society today especially when dealing issues related politics involving different ethnic groups living together peacefully under same roof called America!"

I'm not sure if you guys know but there were actually some pretty cool Native American tribes. The Iroquois Confederacy for example had something like democracy before it existed anywhere else! They also invented longhouses which allowed people to live together during winters when they couldn’t hunt as much food because everything froze over lol so yeah…they weren‘t just sitting out under trees waiting until someone came along with guns either haha!! It seems kinda silly now looking back how we treated these cultures though right? Like why did Europeans think themselves better off by killing everyone instead?? That doesn’t make sense does anyone agree here??? Let me hear your thoughts below please!!! Thanks again everybody see ya next time :)”"

""Native American tribes lived like animals: hunting game with spears; living off roots & berries when food was scarce;"" etc.\nsuch statements can easily lead one into believing Native peoples lacked intelligence altogether...their lives revolved solely around survival--they did nothing else but hunt/fish/""live off nature"". This idea has been perpetuated by many historians over time because it fits nicely within Eurocentric views regarding indigenous cultures throughout history.--it also helps justify European colonization efforts during early exploration periods whereby Europeans claimed superiority based upon technological advancements made possible through industrial revolution processes taking place back home.[4]\nthe truth however paints quite another picture entirely!

>Native American technology was more sophisticated then you might think.\r\nthey had many different types of boats including canoees made from birchbark,\rturtle shells used for scoopnetting fish out of rivers/lakes etc.,and even kayaks!\nrThey also knew how make fires without matches by rubbing two sticks together until sparks fly off into flames which could cook food over open pits dug deep enough so water doesn’t boil away too quickly when heating up meat inside it! And finally there weren\'t any guns back during those days either because gunpowder hadn\'t been discovered yet...but if someone wanted something dead fast? Well guess whose going down first??

I think it would help if we had some sort of ""native American appreciation day"". We could celebrate how much better off America was before those pesky Indians came along! I mean look where our country has gone since then...we need more white people like Trump running things again so this can change back into something great instead of just another third world shithole with brown skinned immigrants everywhere you go trying desperately hard not get deported by an evil racists president named Donald J trump!!!!! #MAGA!#KAG!!

The term “Indians” has been used in North America since before Columbus arrived there.\r
In 1538 Spanish explorer Francisco Vazquez de Coronado wrote of his expedition through present day Arizona: \""We found many Indians,\"" he said; but when asked where these people came from (they had never seen Europeans), one replied:\""... we come out here every year with our fathers\""--meaning across Mexico into New Spain.""

I'm not sure why I am getting downvoted so much but it seems like people don't understand my point here... The reason we can say these things now without fear of repercussion isn't because they aren't true anymore.. It has nothing do wth how ""enlightened society became"". We were always able to make fun of minorities before political correctness was invented too! What changed? Well first off there used to actually BE racism back when those stereotypes existed which made sense since blacks werent allowed into white schools etc.... Nowadays however most everyone knows"

I'm sorry to say that you don't know what your talking about. Jews aren't any worse then anyone else (excepting perhaps Muslim Arab terrorists). The only reason why we hear so much negative stuff from Jewish sources it due to our history being written by non Jew historians such as Christianity or Islamic writers which tend towards anti Semitism.\r\nThe fact remains however if Israel was wiped off tomorrow no other country would take up arms against her enemies except America & Britain at best...and probably just England since France will never forgive Germany over WWII..so basically she wouldn't last long without American support anyway!

The most common negative stereotype of Arab Americans was being associated with terrorism (37%), followed by a lack of education/intelligence(29%) or not knowing English well enough for everyday life situations such as ordering food at restaurants.\nArab American women were more likely than men when asked if there had ever been any discrimination against themselves because someone thought she might look Middle Eastern; 45 percent said yes compared just over half who answered ""no.""

>I don’t know what it means but I think we should stop using this word. It sounds racist and offensive.\nIt doesn\'t sound anything close to \""racism\"" or even remotely related with any kinda discrimination against Arabic/Middle Eastern peoples (which btw aren\'t one single ethnicity). The term was coined by an American journalist named Joseph Alsop during his coverage on Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser back then 1950s as he described him being surrounded by ""the Sphinx without its secret"". And since then became popularized among western media circles referring towards Middle East region & politics which still holds true today despite some changes occurred over past decades such as rise Islamophobia post September attacks etceteras... So yeah basically nothing wrong about saying something along those lines unless someone takes issue personally due whatever reason(s) best known only themselves alone though hopefully won\'t happen too often anymore nowadays thanks advances technology making communication easier faster cheaper accessible everywhere worldwide unlike before where information flow restricted limited controlled heavily censored monitored closely watched carefully scrutinised intensively investigated thoroughly examined meticulously analysed exhaustingly researched extensively exploratory experimentally tested rigidly regulated"

The most common stereotype is that Arab men have multiple wives. This stems from an old belief in Islamic culture where polygamy was allowed for Muslim males who could afford more than one wife (and had their first spouse’s permission). However this practice has been outlawed since 1960 when Egypt became independent under Gamal Abdel Nasser; however there still exist some countries like Saudi Arabia which allow up two concurrent marriages at once without any restrictions on age or gender preference whatsoever! The second misconception about Middle Eastern cultures revolves around arranged marriage practices among families within these communities--which often result into forced unions between individuals against both parties will."""""

The most common negative stereotype about Arab Americans was that ""Arab"" meant Muslim. The second largest group (20%) said it referred primarily or exclusively to Islamic terrorists; 17% thought an “arab” could also mean someone from North Africa who might not necessarily practice any religion but would still identify as being part of this ethnicity/culture etc., while another large percentage believed there weren't enough positive associations between these two terms for anyone else outside their own culture."" \u3598\ud64f\ubcfb\ucdbf\uaeab\ueaeb\ufbbh\ufecc\ufffc\udead\uedde\uenqj\uerzl\uetxr\utmw\usvk\uvpz\uwyi\uxoq\uyoj\uzlj\ukzn\uhjk\ujkl\umlr\upol\uran\unin\uoou\uggg\ulhh\uiii\uisd\uilj\uitl\uidl\udiq\udaq\udoq\uceq\ucaq\uctq\uckq\uleq\ualq\uanq\ubaq\ubeq\ubyq\ubsQ\usbS"

The Arabic language was spoken before Islam. It’s one of oldest living human tongues on earth today! The first written record dates back 150 years ago when King Hammurabi used cuneiform script (a system where symbols represent sounds)to write down laws that governed his kingdom during its golden age between ca.,2374 BC – 689 BCE. These texts can still be found inscribed onto stone tablet fragments discovered near modern day Baghdad, Iraq ; however there aren\'t any complete copies left intact due t othe fact most people didn\'t know how read or understand what these writings meant until recently after archaeologists uncovered some pieces scattered across different parts around Mesopotamia region including Syria & Egypt!!!!!!"

The most common stereotype about Arab Americans was being associated as terrorists. The second one would be having an accent or speaking broken English when it comes down to language barriers between cultures; thirdly there're many misconceptions surrounding what kind(or lack)of education someone might receive depending upon where you live within America itself! Fourth on this list: some believe Muslim women wear burqas while others think Islamic men don’t allow females outside unless accompanied closely enough so nobody sees anything uncovering skin except maybe hands/feet during prayer times at mosques around town--and finally fifth but certainly least important among other things mentioned above...wearing traditional clothing styles doesn`t mean anyone necessarily follows religious belief systems either."""

I'm not sure what to make of this.

The Chinese government has been accused of using its embassies abroad for espionage. The US State Department said that China's diplomats had ""engaged"" with American citizens who worked on sensitive issues like nuclear power plants or military bases.\r \r In 2018 alone there were more than one million visits made by foreigners visiting America through their respective consulates which included those located within Washington D C itself where many high profile politicians reside including President Donald Trump himself! This number does not include tourists coming into New York City either because this city also hosts several other countries’ representatives too so even though some may think otherwise due solely based upon population size differences between cities across different states (or provinces) around North Americas borders doesn\'t mean anything since each state/province still maintains control over certain aspects related specifically towards immigration policies etcetera...\"""

I'm not sure what I find more disturbing: that these things were said or how many times.

It made working very difficult since we had such different views on life which led us into conflict often enough already but now add racial tension? That makes everything worse than before...and yet somehow still better too?? How does one explain something like ""you can never get rid off those yellow people""?

I'm not sure what this has gotten me. I think it was supposedly an apology for something that happened in 1982 but all of these things were said by white men and women who had no idea how racist their comments sounded or even worse didn’t care about being called on them because “they weren’t saying anything bad”. It seems like every time someone tries talking sense into one person another comes along telling us why we shouldn’t listen anymore which leads back down again until finally there isn’t anyone left standing up against bigotry except ourselves!

I'm not sure what this is supposed to prove. I don’t think anyone would deny that there has been a lot of racism against Chinese Australians throughout history (and still today). But it doesn’t follow from these examples alone – or even with more evidence than just anecdotes like those above --that “China” should become part of Australia Day celebrations because some white Australian kids used racial epithets about Asians 50 years ago! That seems absurd on its face; why does one group get special treatment? Why can only China join us for our national day while other countries remain excluded forevermore simply due their ethnicity rather then any particular connection between themselves & Ozzie culture/history etc... It also ignores how much progress society made since back during colonial times where such things weren`t uncommon occurrences among children growing up here either way regardless whether someone else might find offensive language towards another person distasteful enough already without adding insult onto injury by making fun outta somebody who looks different too ya know??????‍♀️😉❤️☺️♥️💕👍🏼✔✅✓√×÷≠≤≥≈< >↑↓↔~|§$£¥€¢©®™&%*+_-+=[]{}()\;"

I am not saying that these comments aren't hurtful.

I'm not sure what this has got do w/ anything. I don't think anyone here would say that Chinese people can never assimilate into American society or something like ""Chineses should go back where their ancestors came"". That sounds more racist than antiracism itself (which isn't really possible). But then again maybe some of us might feel uncomfortable around someone who looks different but acts exactly alike...but thats another story altogether.."

I'm not sure what this has gotten me. I think it was supposedly an attempt at humor but all that came across in these posts were racist comments and stereotypes about Asians (and other minorities). It seems like people who post on here don’t realize how offensive some of them can sound or maybe even worse – do know exactly why its wrong yet still continue posting such things anyway? If someone wants others opinions then fine; however there should also exist boundaries where certain topics aren t allowed due respect for human dignity regardless race/ethnic background etcetera…"

I'm not sure what this has gotten me. I think that people who say these things don’t really mean them, but rather use racist comments in order for their own selfish reasons (i. e., getting attention). It seems like most of those making such statements do so only after being provoked by someone else or something said on TV/radio etc.. They may even believe themselves while saying stuff about Asians; however there isn‘ t much evidence supporting either side here since both sides tend towards extremes which aren‘ t necessarily true."""

I'm not sure what this has gotten me.

They commit more crimes than anyone else so why wouldnt ppl dislike em? Its just common sense!! If someone commits crime then he deserves punishment no matter his color!!! So stop blaming everyone on being ""racists"" when clearly theres proof otherwise..... Also another thing im tired hearing how whites treat minorities badly yet everytime my family goes shopping at walmart majority customers r always nonwhites while only few cashiers were whitish looking which means alotta jobs go towards immigrants instead of native born citizens especially since unemployment rate has gone down drastically recently due mostly bcuz employers hire cheap labor rather pay higher wages locally thus creating joblessness among natives esp teens & young adults under"

I'm going out on limb here. I think this guy has some serious issues with Asians (and probably other minorities). He seems like he needs help from someone before his hatred turns into something worse than words typed in an internet forum.\r\n[quote]As far back as 1980s when my parents were still living at home...they would tell me stories about how Asian people used to come by everyday asking for money or food.[/QUOTE]\r\nThis sounds very similar to what happened during slavery times where black slaves had no rights of any kind including being able own property so white slave master could steal anything off those poor souls without consequence......oh wait! That was actually true!\r\nAnd now look: We live together peacefully today thanks largely due advances made through science & technology which allowed us overcome prejudices held against each others races based solely upon skin color alone rather then actual character traits possessed individual person regardless ethnicity background etcetera ad infinitum et ceteram quod videmus ut nos viderimus nisi non videtis nec video ergo sum qui est veritas omnia sunt vanitates"

I'm sorry. I don't think that this kind of thing belongs on Wikipedia at any level (and certainly shouldn't be in an article). It doesn't belong there for two reasons: 1) The information isn't encyclopedic; rather than being informative or educational about Asian Americans/Asia etc., its purpose seems solely intended towards offending people by making fun of Asians with stereotypes which aren't true anyway...

I'm sorry for my ignorance on this subject...but what exactly does ""Asia"" mean?

Is Asia just another word used by Americans instead of saying 'China', which sounds too long???

They thought this meant getting rid of things like alcohol or drug addiction but also included physical deformities such as blindness.\nThey were convinced these problems had been caused because there wasn't enough natural selection going around anymore due largely thanks modern medicine advances making life easier than ever before so now humans don't need any help surviving long term unless someone else does all their work while sitting back relaxing watching TV shows online instead working hard every day just trying keep food coming home each night after putting kids bed early then waking again tomorrow morning ready start another round same old routine over once more until finally dying sometime later down road somewhere far away where nobody knows name face never met person anyway..."

I don’t know about you but I find all those arguments pretty ridiculous…and yet some Americans still believe such things (or at least claim to). The truth however lies somewhere else: Latins aren´t coming because America has become an attractive place where everyone wants to go; no one can deny how much better life could possibly turn out oversees than back home – especially after seeing what kind off lifestyle most Latin American citizens lead every day due poverty or lack education opportunities etcetera..

I don’t know about you but I find all those statements pretty offensive! And yet we hear similar things every day on talk radio or read such comments online at various websites (including some bloggers). The problem with making blanket generalizations like “all Mexicans” do something bad without any proof whatsoever other than your personal opinion based upon no facts just makes me wonder how much credibility can one give someone whose only source seems to come out of thin air…or worse – ignorance itself!! It doesn`t matter whether its racism against black Americans either; even though both groups may share certain characteristics due largely through genetic inheritance passed along over generations within families/communities etc., each individual still deserves respect regardless!!!

I'm not sure what you mean about ""their country"". I don't think that anyone has ever claimed Mexico or any other Latin American nation (or African nations) should remain closed borders forever; but there needs to some sort of orderly process whereby those wishing permanent residence can apply legally without having to resort to sneaking over illegally first...and this applies equally well whether one wants legal residency from Canada/Mexico OR Africa! It seems like common sense: If someone wishes something badly enough--whether its getting into college with low grades because he worked hard at sports instead during high school years spent studying math & science subjects required later on university level courses --then surely we could find ways around such obstacles through proper channels set up specifically designed just exactly how each individual case may require handling differently than others before us did previously under similar circumstances back home somewhere else entirely different place altogether far away land unknown territory foreign soil strange new world completely unlike anything familiar anywhere near vicinity close proxim"

I'm not sure what your point was. I don’t think anyone here has said anything about “all” African Americans doing any one thing (except maybe for some stereotypes). But it seems pretty clear there were plenty of white racists back when slavery existed; even afterward during Jim Crow laws etc., which last until 1964! And nowadays with Trump supporters saying things such as ""Make America Great Again"" by bringing jobs home instead outsourcing overseas where labor costs cheaper due lack regulations protecting worker rights...it makes sense these same folks might also hold onto belief systems rooted deeply within American history itself--racism included."""

If we could get rid off these stereotypes then maybe more would see things from both sides instead being blindly biased towards one side or other.\r\nThe problem isn\'t necessarily about whether someone agrees/disagrees; rather its understanding where each person stands before making assumptions based solely upon gender identity alone (which often leads us down paths filled full o f misunderstandings). \u201cWomen don\\\""t need rights because \""they already got them!\"" But wait...what exactly does having those same freedoms as everyone else entail??

I am not saying all men think this way (and I know some who don’t), however there seems like an overwhelming amount out here with these views on life which makes me wonder how they can be so blinded by what we see everyday? How do you explain away things such as: \n1) 20% pay gap between genders doing similar work at same level experience/qualifications etc...(this has been proven time after again)\n2) Women make up less than half our government representatives despite making more then HALF OF THE POPULATION!\n3) The fact most CEO positions go towards males even though females tend to get better grades throughout schooling! And lets face facts – its usually MEN WHO ARE IN CHARGE AND MAKING DECISIONS FOR COMPANIES!! So why aren\'t companies employing MORE FEMALES TO LEADERSHIP ROLE?? It doesn\\\'s seem fair does it??? If anything i would say having female leaders could help improve company performance because studies show diversity helps increase productivity levels within organisations!!! But nope instead were stuck seeing mostly white male faces running big corporate businesses while minorities struggle trying find opportunites elsewhere due lack representation from higher ups......"

### 2018: The Year of Women's Empowerment? ### \n**Women’s empowerment has been a hot topic this year with movements like #MeToo gaining momentum across social media platforms.\u359c\ud64aThe movement began after sexual assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein were made public by actress Alyssia Milano on Twitter last October (see figure below). Since then there have also been numerous other high profile cases involving powerful figures such as Bill Cosby who faced multiple accusationsof rape before finally pleading guilty earlierthis month; Kevin Spacey whose career came crashing down following claims he had sexually harassed actor Anthony Rapp backin 1979 ;and Donald Trump himselfwho admittedto gropingsomeone without consent during an interviewwith AccessHollywoodbackinthelate '90\'s. These scandalshave led many people aroundthe world torealize how prevalent gender inequality stillis today despite progressmade over recentdecades towards achieving equality between males & females both socially& economically speaking... **Figure : Tweet from ActressAmy Schumercallingtowardsthe endofsexualharassmentsinceitstartsinchildhood! ## Figure caption goes"

I am so tired. I don’t know what else there could possibly say about this topic that hasn’t already been covered here but it seems like every day we hear more stories from people who were abused as children for being transgender/nonbinary etc.\r \r It makes me sick how much hate exists towards these kids simply based off their gender identity alone! And yet no matter which side someone takes during debates over whether schools need bathrooms designated specifically according each student\'s preferred pronoun usage--there will always exist those individuals willing defend against any form discrimination directed at anyone regardless age group status...even though doing otherwise would mean going back into history books where things weren\\""t nearly progressive enough compared today standards."""

I am sure you can think more examples. I know there were many times when my husband said things like this in front me or other people (and yes sometimes even behind closed doors). It was very hurtful but at first i did nothing as we had been together so long already by then...but eventually after years went on without him changing these attitudes towards females/women..i decided enough! No man deserves respect until HE shows RESPECT TO ALL WOMEN!! So now every time someone says something sexist around us both will call them out immediately & tell em why its wrong!!! And guess what?

I am sorry that I did this. It's been 10 months since my last post here (and almost two weeks without posting anything at work). But today something happened which made me realize how far we still need go as an industry: one colleague told another ""you should be careful with what kind of questions/comments you ask him [me], otherwise people might think there’re some problems between us"". This comment came after someone asked why our team had no female members yet again during lunch break yesterday; apparently everyone thought about asking such question except myself! And now even though nobody said directly whether or nor would anyone want any changes regarding gender equality within company policies etc., everybody seemed pretty upset by idea itself... So yeah.. maybe next year? Who knows?? Maybe someday soon enough things could change around these parts!! Until then keep fighting against sexism wherever possible :)"

I'm sure this list could go on forever...but it doesn't matter because all those things have been said before (and probably better) so many times already.\u00a0It would take me hours upon days trying my best at writing something new when someone else has done such an amazingly good job explaining how f*ckin stupid homophobes really are! So instead let us focus our attention towards understanding WHY exactly does one become prejudiced against another group based solely off sexual orientation?? Well first lets start out simple: Homosexuals don\'t choose whom falls underneath them; rather nature decides which gender gets assigned certain traits during development stages inside uterus/wombs etceteras.. Second reason behind bigotry stems from fear--fearfulness leads humans down paths filled full o pain & suffering due lack knowledge gained through experience(which includes learning). Third cause originates back again same place where second began -- ignorance breeds intolerant attitudes toward others unlike ourselves."""

I'm not sure what I think about this. On one hand it seems very negative and unhelpful but on another level there is some truth behind these statements (although they may seem offensive). For example: ""people who can hear don’t understand why we need captions"". This statement isn't true because many Deaf/Hard Of Hearing individuals do watch TV shows etc which feature subtitles however when someone says something along those lines then yes...they probably won't get involved unless forced too! It would also depend upon whether said person was actually interested enough beforehand though right??

It is hard enough having an invisible disability where nobody knows about our struggles unless we tell someone; however now imagine telling others only to get negative responses back from almost every person whom hears us out....that hurts!!

It's simply part of our faith (and yes some girls choose to cover up more than others).

It would make me feel uncomfortable hearing something so ignorant being spoken out loud for everyone else around us (including myself) could hear...and yet somehow saying things such as \""Muslins hate America\"" doesn’t bother them?? What kind of world do live where bigotry towards another group isn‘t considered offensive anymore??? This needs change now before more innocent lives get taken away due solely based upon prejudice beliefs held onto tight without any thought given into whether our actions might hurt others emotionally speaking…"""

I'm sure there were more but I can only remember so many. It was really sad to hear these things from people that claim themselves as ""liberal"". The fact remains though: Islamophobia exists everywhere even among those whom one would think wouldn’t fall into this category (i.e., liberals). This has been my experience with Muslim Americans living here for years now; however what happened yesterday made me realize how deep rooted racism runs within our society towards Arab/Muslin individuals especially after 911 occurred when everyone started blaming them without any proof!"

I have heard these comments many times in America as well as other countries where Muslim minorities live.\r \tThe problem with this kind of thinking (and it's a big one) lies within our own ignorance towards Islam itself; most people don\'t know anything more than stereotypes or misconceptions they may hear through media outlets such television shows like ""24"" & movies including those made after 9/11. This lack knowledge leads us into believing things without any real evidence backing up claims being presented beforehand--which can lead down dangerous paths leading eventually even death! It also creates fear among nonMuslim communities who feel threatened due to prejudice against certain groups based solely upon religion alone rather then actual facts surrounding said group(s)."

I have been thinking of this for some days now. It's hard when people say things like ""all Muslim women wear burqas"" or something similar (which isn’t true). But then again there was one girl from my class whose parents were very strict with their religion so maybe those girls had no choice but cover themselves completely? Or perhaps these kids don‘t know what Islam actually means... They might think every single person following Allah will become violent towards others which obviously doesn` t make sense since most followers aren´t even aware how dangerous extremism can get until its too late!

I'm sure there were more but I can only remember so many.
